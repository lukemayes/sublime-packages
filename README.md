User packages for Sublime Text.
------------------------------

There's nothing brilliant here. Just an easy way to back up some of my Sublime config and track changes.
If you find some use from it, :). That's it.

Currently, I'm using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com) on OSX so your mileage may vary.
